Investigating Earth’s Inner Core Nucleation Paradox by Simulating Iron and Silicon Atoms

Unravel the mystery of Earth's inner core formation with this GitHub repository. Investigating the detected presence of the inner core, which challenges established cooling rates, seismic data, and previous studies, this research explores the impact of silicon in the nucleation process. Using LAMMPS for molecular dynamics simulations, akin to prior studies on iron–oxygen alloys, we examine iron–silicon mixtures. Despite obtaining an initial critical undercooling value of 69 ± 69 K, the uncertain data hinders conclusive insights. The study suggests future research combining LAMMPS simulations and pre-freezing nuclei methods, spanning various systems like pure iron and iron alloys (oxygen, sulfur, silicon) to decode the inner core nucleation puzzle. Python is employed for data processing and statistical analysis, enhancing the repository's capability to unravel crucial insights from complex simulations.
